# Project Startup

## Step 1: Ensure Environment Readiness

Please make sure that Node.js is installed on your computer.

## Step 2: Install Project Dependencies

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing your project files using the `cd` command.
3. Once in the root directory of the project (where the `package.json` file is located), execute the following command to install all necessary dependencies:
```
npm install
```
## Step 3: Run the Project

After the dependencies have been installed, you can start the project with the following command:
```
npm run dev
```
This command will launch a local server and automatically open a default web browser window to display the project.
